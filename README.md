# Blood-Disease-Classification

This project applies Machine Learning and Deep Learning to classify blood samples and predict potential diseases based on various biomarkers. The dataset is processed, cleaned, and used to train multiple ML models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks (Keras).  

Project Overview  
- Objective: Predict diseases based on blood sample biomarkers using ML models.  
- Dataset: Blood sample records with various health indicators.  
- Technologies Used: 
  - Python   
  - Pandas, NumPy (Data Preprocessing)  
  - Seaborn, Plotly (Data Visualization)  
  - Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)  
  - Keras & TensorFlow (Deep Learning)  

- ML Models Implemented:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
